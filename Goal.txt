1. Simulate a cache correctly
2. Establish strong baselines (FIFO, LRU)
3. Generate meaningful access patterns
4. Learn eviction behavior from data
5. Evaluate with cache-specific metrics
6. Analyze when and why learning helps



Step 1. Defining the scope

Cache type: Fully associative
Cache size: Fixed (e.g., 8 or 16)
Workloads: Synthetic
Output: Eviction decision
Evaluation: Hit / miss ratio


Step 2. Building cache simulator

Create a simple Python class:

Cache
    Attributes:
        capacity
        entries

    Methods:
        access(item)
        evict()
